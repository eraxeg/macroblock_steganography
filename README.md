# DCT Decoy

*"Decennia of conditioning the user to ignore these visual artifacts and to pay attention only to the overall image
has changed these artifacts into the ultimate camouflage for secret messaging."*

DCT Decoy is software that expands on Rosa Menkman's DCT (2015), a "font that [...] uses methods of cryptography and steganography; secretly hidden, the message is transcoded and embedded on the surface of
the image where it looks like a JPEG artifact (glitch)." Using Menkman's DCT font, it is possible to steganographically encode a message onto the image surface. The message is possible to decode with the [▇▇▇ KEY ▇▇ — ▋▅▉▝▊](https://beyondresolution.info/KEY).

DCT Decoy enables encoding and decoding messages following the same principle by directly manipulating the JPEG compression.
